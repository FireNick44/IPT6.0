## Introduction

I created this project during my schooltime to create a login page. In this repository you can find the seperate overlay for this login page. 

## How it was made

The project was created with HTML CSS and JavaScript. 
No libraries or other external resources were used. _(apart from the font)_

The pure CSS background comes from an site that provides beautiful CSS backgrounds. The transparent cards are also made with the help of a external page.

## Features

The project offers an all around good login system layout. When you start the website there is a loader animation so that possible large files can be downloaded in the background. In addition, there is a dark- and lightmode that remains memorized.

## Known issues

The website was tested on Chrome and Edge without any problems. However, on Firefox and Safari there were issues with displaying the svg's.
